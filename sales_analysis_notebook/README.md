# Sales Analysis Notebook (Pandas + Seaborn)

This notebook walks through a mini, end-to-end data workflow:

1. Create a **messy** dataset
2. **Clean** and standardize values (strings, numerics, missing values)
3. Engineer a **Price Band** feature (Cheap / Affordable / Expensive)
4. Build a small **SalesAnalyzer** class for grouped summaries
5. Visualize results with a **SalesVisualizer** class (Seaborn)

## How to Run
Open `sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter (VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or Notebook) and execute cells from top to bottom.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Grouping, aggregation, and summaries
- Feature engineering with quantiles
- Object-oriented helpers for analysis/visualization
- Seaborn charts for data storytelling
