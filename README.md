🧠 Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects created to practice and strengthen programming and data analysis skills.
Each project focuses on a different concept — from core Python (loops, functions, data structures) to data cleaning and analysis with NumPy and Pandas.

📂 Projects
1. ✅ To-Do List Manager

A command-line application for managing simple daily tasks.

Key Features:

Add, remove, and display tasks using text commands

Continuous execution until user quits

Great for practicing list operations, user input, and control flow

Concepts Practiced:

Lists

Loops

Functions

Conditional logic

📁 Folder: todo_list_manager/

2. 📊 Student Performance Report

A data analysis project using Pandas and NumPy to merge student info with subject scores and calculate performance metrics.

Key Features:

Merge multiple DataFrames

Compute average scores and pass/fail status

Categorize students (Excellent / Good / Needs Work)

Summarize class-level performance

Rank top performers

Concepts Practiced:

DataFrame manipulation

Merging and joining

Grouping and aggregation

Conditional logic (np.select)

Ranking and summary reporting

📁 Folder: student_performance_report/

3. 🧹 Data Cleaning Practice

A project focused on data preparation and cleaning using Pandas and NumPy.
It takes messy, inconsistent data and transforms it into a clean, structured DataFrame ready for analysis.

Key Features:

Handle missing values (drop or fill with mean/median)

Convert data types (to_numeric, to_datetime)

Standardize text (trim spaces, title-case, uppercase)

Extract date features (year, month)

Validate data integrity and completeness

Concepts Practiced:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering

Text normalization

Type conversion

Exploratory data validation

📁 Folder: data_cleaning_practice/

🧰 Skills Covered

Core Python (data types, loops, functions, conditionals)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

NumPy (arrays, operations, slicing)

Pandas (data analysis, merging, cleaning, grouping, pivot tables)

Data Cleaning (handling missing values, standardization, validation)

Clean code organization and documentation
