# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects created to practice and strengthen programming and data analysis skills.  
Each project focuses on a different concept — from core Python (loops, functions, data structures) to data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas.

## Projects

### 1. To-Do List Manager
A command-line application for managing simple daily tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Add, remove, and display tasks using commands
- Runs continuously until the user chooses to quit
- Great for practicing list operations, user input, and control flow

**Concepts Practiced:**
- Lists  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Conditional logic

### 2. Student Performance Report
A Pandas-based data analysis script that merges student info with subject scores and calculates performance metrics.

**Key Features:**
- Merges multiple DataFrames  
- Calculates average scores and pass/fail status  
- Categorizes performance (Excellent / Good / Needs Work)  
- Groups by class to summarize averages and pass rates  
- Creates pivot tables for reporting

**Concepts Practiced:**
- DataFrame creation and manipulation  
- Merging and joining  
- Grouping and aggregation  
- Conditional logic using `np.select`  
- Pivot tables and summary reporting

---

## Skills Covered
- Core Python (data types, loops, functions, conditionals)  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- NumPy (arrays, operations, slicing)  
- Pandas (data analysis, merging, grouping, pivot tables)  
- Clean code organization and documentation

## Next Steps
This repository will continue to grow with more projects, including:
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Algorithm and data structure exercises
- Mini data science analyses and reports

The goal is to build a clear, well-documented learning portfolio showing consistent progress in Python programming and analytics.
