# 📝 To-Do List Manager

This is a small Python project I built while practicing the basics of programming.  
It’s a simple command-line app where you can keep track of your tasks by adding them, removing them, and showing the full list.

The idea was to practice how lists, loops, and functions work together in Python, but it turned into a fun little tool.

## How it works
When you run the program, it asks you to type commands:

- **`add <task>`** → adds a new task  
- **`remove <task>`** → removes a task if it exists  
- **`show`** → shows all your current tasks, numbered  
- **`quit`** → exits the program  

Example:

add buy milk
Added: buy milk

add read book
Added: read book

show

buy milk

read book

remove buy milk
Removed: buy milk

show

read book

quit
Goodbye!

## Why I built this
I’m using small projects like this to refresh and strengthen my Python skills.  
This one is simple, but it helped me practice:
- Handling user input
- Working with lists
- Writing functions
- Using loops to keep a program running

## What’s next
In the future, I’d like to improve it by:
- Preventing duplicate tasks  
- Saving tasks to a file so they don’t disappear when the program ends  
- Maybe even building a simple GUI version someday
