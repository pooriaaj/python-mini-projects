# 🧰 Python Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of small, hands-on Python projects I’m building while strengthening my programming and data-analysis skills.  
Each project focuses on a different concept — from core Python (loops, functions, data structures) to libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 📁 Projects

### 📝 To-Do List Manager
A command-line tool to manage daily tasks.  
**Focus:** Lists, loops, functions, user input.

- `add <task>` → adds a task  
- `remove <task>` → removes a task if it exists  
- `show` → displays all tasks  
- `quit` → exits the program

**Why it matters:**  
Helped me practice input handling, loops, conditionals, and list operations.

### 📊 Student Performance Report
Merges student info with subject scores using Pandas.  
**Focus:** DataFrames, merge, aggregation, grouping, conditions.

- Calculates averages and pass/fail
- Categorizes students (Excellent, Good, Needs Work)
- Summarizes performance by class

**Why it matters:**  
Introduced data wrangling, joins, and groupby analytics in Pandas.

## 🧩 Skills Practiced

- ✅ Core Python (functions, loops, conditionals, data structures)
- ✅ OOP basics (classes and objects)
- ✅ NumPy (arrays, math, conditions)
- ✅ Pandas (data analysis, grouping, pivot tables)
- ✅ Clean code & structured READMEs

## 🚀 What’s Next
I’ll keep expanding this repository with:
- More mini-projects for each concept
- Data-visualization practice (Matplotlib / Seaborn)
- Algorithm challenges
- Small data-science analyses

Stay tuned! ✨
