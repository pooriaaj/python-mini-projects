# 📝 To-Do List Manager

This is a small Python project I built while practicing the basics of programming.  
It’s a simple command-line app where you can keep track of your tasks by adding them, removing them, and showing the full list.

The idea was to practice how lists, loops, and functions work together in Python, but it turned into a fun little tool.

## How it works
When you run the program, it asks you to type commands:

- **`add <task>`** → adds a new task  
- **`remove <task>`** → removes a task if it exists  
- **`show`** → shows all your current tasks, numbered  
- **`quit`** → exits the program
