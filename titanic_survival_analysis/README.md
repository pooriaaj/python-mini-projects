# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Analysis & Machine Learning Model

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to understand survival patterns and build a predictive model using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-Learn**.  
It covers every step from **data cleaning and EDA** to **feature engineering**, **model comparison**, and **final predictions**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Explore relationships between survival and features such as sex, class, family, and titles.
- Clean and preprocess the data (missing values, feature encoding).
- Engineer meaningful features (family size, is_alone, titles).
- Build and compare multiple ML models.
- Generate predictions for Kaggle submission.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering & encoding
- Handling missing values
- Model training, validation & evaluation
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC
- Generating test predictions for Kaggle

---

## ðŸ“Š Models Evaluated
| Model | Accuracy (Validation) |
|-------|------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.79 |
| Random Forest | ~0.83 |
| Support Vector Classifier | ~0.80 |

âœ… Random Forest performed best on validation data.
